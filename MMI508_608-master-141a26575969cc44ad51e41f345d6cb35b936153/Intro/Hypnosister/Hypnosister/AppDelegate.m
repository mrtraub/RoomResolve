    NSString *myString2 = [[NSString alloc] initWithUTF8String:"meow"];

    // These are also handy for quickly making arrays, for example
    NSArray *myArray = @[@1, @2, @3];
    // the outside literal @[...] turns everything inside [..] into an NSObject (in this case an NSArray), and the literals on the inside [@1, @2, @3] also turn each element into an NSObject (in this case an NSNumber)
    
    NSArray *myArray2 = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:[[NSNumber alloc] initWithInt:1],
                                                        [[NSNumber alloc] initWithInt:2],
                                                        [[NSNumber alloc] initWithInt:3],

    NSLog(@"%@ ... %@", myArray, myArray2);
    // use whichever you prefer...
    
    // so in the line above: @[self.rootVC, self.remindVC]; tabBarController.viewControllers is expecting an NSArray of view controllers, so we use the @ literal to quickly make that array, which is functionally equivalent to:
