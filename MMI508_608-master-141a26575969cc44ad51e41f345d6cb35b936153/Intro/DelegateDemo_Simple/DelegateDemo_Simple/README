So why are delegates useful?

Two main reasons:
1) Asynchronous callback
2) Repeated callback


1) Asynchronous callback

Delegates provide a way for long-running or delayed code to "call back later"

This is common for things like:
    -Long processing jobs
    -Network calls
    -Event-driven calls

In this example:
(assuming the customer does not start with a full tank)
-The customer tells the attendant to fill up the tank
-The attendant spawns a new thread to fill the tank, then returns execution to the customer on the original thread
-The customer continues executing the code in goGetGasFromAttendant on the first thread (i.e. starts reading a book)
    Note in the log messages that the customer reads a book at the same time the attendant pours gas
-When the attendant finishes (on the second thread), it "calls back" to the customer via doneFillingUp
-The customer code (now running on the second thread) then sets the mReadyToLeave flag
-Elsewhere in the customer code (still running on the first thread), the while loop ends and the customer drives home

A note about threading:
There is no way for the caller to implicitly know what thread it will be on when doneFillingUp is called
In this example, the thread that executes doneFillingUp depends on the initial tank level
If the initial tank level is 10, the attendant executes doneFillingUp immediately (does not spawn a new thread)
If the level is < 10, the attendant spawns the second thread, and doneFillingUp is executed on that thread once the tank is full



2) Repeated callback

Delegates allow code to be called as necessary, whether it be 0 or many times

This is common for UI elements such as UITableViews
For example:
    A UIViewController registers as a UITableViewDelegate
    The tableView calls back whenever the user selects a cell in the table


An enhancement for this project would be to add another method to CustomerDelegate:
    -(void) updateStatus:(NSString *)message
This would allow for the attendant to occasionally update the customer on status, i.e. "I added another gallon"
